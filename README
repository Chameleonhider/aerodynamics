About:
This is a little physics program. Lots of features missing.
Uses object pools and space partitioning to considerably speed up the simulation.
Uses NACA 4 digit wing generator.

Install/compile:
You may need to install 'libsdl2-dev' (you should already have 'libm')
Compile and launch the program with 'gcc-compile' or use 'make && ./program'

Controls:
SPACEBAR - frame skip, i.e. run faster than 60fps, useful at simulation start
MOUSE LEFT - add particles
MOUSE MIDDLE - speed up nearby particles in the current space partition
MOUSE RIGHT - delete particles from current space partition

Tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 on arm64
