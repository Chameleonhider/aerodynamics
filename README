About:
	This is a little physics program. Lots of features missing.
	Uses object pools and space partitioning to considerably speed up the simulation.
	Uses NACA 4 digit wing generator.

Install/compile:
	You may need to install 'libsdl2-dev' (you should already have 'libm')
	Compile and launch the program with 'gcc-compile' or use 'make && ./program'
	Tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 on arm64 (i7-6700)

Controls:
	SPACEBAR - frame skip, i.e. run faster than 60fps, useful at simulation start
	MOUSE LEFT - add particles
	MOUSE MIDDLE - colour particles in current space partition
	MOUSE RIGHT - delete particles from current space partition
	ARROW UP/DOWN - rotate the airfoil
	Q - quit

Planned features:
	more NACA wing generators
	better physics (speed of sound, Reynolds number, etc.)
	physics multithreading with pthreads
	ditch the particles; make quadtrees, with leaf nodes handling pressure/velocity
	if simulation runs fast enough, make a game out of it
